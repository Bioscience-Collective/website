        As hackathon organizers, we are doing all the "dirty work" to make
        events happen. And now more than ever, we need better tools and
        platforms to make organizing easy and efficient, even when we are
        remote.

      <p className="font-bold">
        Join us to build the tools that you wish you had for the next generation
        of hackathon organizers.
